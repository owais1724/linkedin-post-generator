  "text": "3 years into product management, I've realized the PMs who thrive long-term aren't the ones chasing the next shiny framework. They're the ones quietly investing in themselves. Here's what I've learned about building a career that survives layoffs, pivots, and whatever chaos comes next.\n\n1. Pick One Thing Outside Your Daily Grind\n\nChoose something small that stretches you. Maybe it's actually reading those analytics reports instead of skimming them, or navigating AI tools to simplify your tasks. Don't expect anyone to notice right away — that's not the point.\n\n2. Help People Around You\n\nPM is all about relationships. Help that engineer understand why users are frustrated, or spend time onboarding the new designer properly. These moments matter more than nailing your next roadmap presentation.\n\n3. Try Something That Might Fail\n\nDo something you've never done before. A PM I know started writing internal case studies about failed features. Sounds boring? It taught her to think critically about what went wrong and communicate those insights clearly. Skills that made her indispensable.\n\n4. Learn Something Every Quarter\n\nPick one thing per quarter. Maybe it's a skill that helps you excel at work, maybe it's how to actually say no to stakeholders without burning bridges. Small, consistent learning beats cramming for your next promotion.\n\n5. Stop Optimizing for Right Now\n\nAsk yourself: 'What kind of PM do I want to be in 5 years?' Not 'What gets me promoted next month.' The difference is learning to communicate vision vs. just learning the latest A/B testing tool.\n\n6. Follow What Actually Interests You\n\nDon't just chase resume bullets. Learn things because they're genuinely interesting, even if they seem useless. Understanding how customer support works, reading about behavioral psychology, or learning basic SQL — these 'random' skills often become your secret weapons.\n\n7. Build Habits That Stick\n\nFocus on what you can sustain long-term. Maybe it's spending 15 minutes every Friday reviewing what you learned that week. Pick something small and stick with it.\n\n8. Remember What You Actually Control\n\nCompanies restructure, products get killed, teams get reshuffled. But the way you think about problems, the people who trust you, and your ability to figure things out — that stuff travels with you everywhere.\n\n9. Invest in Yourself First\n\nThe work you do on yourself is the only permanent asset in your career. Every quarter, make some kind of deposit. That's how you go from someone who executes roadmaps to someone who shapes product strategy.\n\n10. Keep Going\n\nThe investment mindset is what separates PMs who survive from PMs who thrive. It's the only thing that never gets disrupted.",

Direct acquaintances, your WhatsApp connects or even college groups\n2. Your LinkedIn connections\n3. People who have hiring label in their profile, just go to company profile on LinkedIn -> people -> hiring\n\nAim at least 5 people for one company.\n\nSample referral Notes (these are the exact ones I used):\n\n📍While sending Connection request:\n\nHey [Name], How are you?  I came across an opening at [company] for [z] role, [job id]. I graduated from [college] and have [x] years of experience in the Product team at [company]. I find myself a right fit for the role, can you refer me for the same?\n\n📍If connection request is accepted (you don’t want to delay this, be very proactive here):\n\nHey [Name], thanks for accepting my request.\nSharing you my resume below, would be really helpful if you could provide a referral.\n\n📍If they have shared resume with hiring team and you want to follow up:\n\nHey [Name],\nI was wondering if you could advise me on how I can track the progress of my application at [company]? Do you have a specific portal or should I follow up with someone directly?\n\nP.S: Don’t forget to follow up and keep a track that you actually have received a referral also.\n\n💡This trick will definitely help you increase conversions, only if you find the right person to get a referral from.\n\nDo try this out!",

Getting an opportunity to speak at college events among 100s of students.\n4. Asking for the pay that I deserve.\n5. Getting ownership of a project and leading it end-to-end.\n\nAlong with a lot of other things.\n\nI didn’t beg for these things, but instead of accepting the scenarios I chose to pitch in and ask for what I deserved.\n\nPlease please always take a stand for yourself, because if you won’t then nobody else will.",
