        "text": "3 years into product management, I've realized the PMs who thrive long-term aren't the ones chasing the next shiny framework. They're the ones quietly investing in themselves. Here's what I've learned about building a career that survives layoffs, pivots, and whatever chaos comes next.\n\n1. Pick One Thing Outside Your Daily Grind\n\nChoose something small that stretches you. Maybe it's actually reading those analytics reports instead of skimming them, or navigating AI tools to simplify your tasks. Don't expect anyone to notice right away \u2014 that's not the point.\n\n2. Help People Around You\n\nPM is all about relationships. Help that engineer understand why users are frustrated, or spend time onboarding the new designer properly. These moments matter more than nailing your next roadmap presentation.\n\n3. Try Something That Might Fail\n\nDo something you've never done before. A PM I know started writing internal case studies about failed features. Sounds boring? It taught her to think critically about what went wrong and communicate those insights clearly. Skills that made her indispensable.\n\n4. Learn Something Every Quarter\n\nPick one thing per quarter. Maybe it's a skill that helps you excel at work, maybe it's how to actually say no to stakeholders without burning bridges. Small, consistent learning beats cramming for your next promotion.\n\n5. Stop Optimizing for Right Now\n\nAsk yourself: 'What kind of PM do I want to be in 5 years?' Not 'What gets me promoted next month.' The difference is learning to communicate vision vs. just learning the latest A/B testing tool.\n\n6. Follow What Actually Interests You\n\nDon't just chase resume bullets. Learn things because they're genuinely interesting, even if they seem useless. Understanding how customer support works, reading about behavioral psychology, or learning basic SQL \u2014 these 'random' skills often become your secret weapons.\n\n7. Build Habits That Stick\n\nFocus on what you can sustain long-term. Maybe it's spending 15 minutes every Friday reviewing what you learned that week. Pick something small and stick with it.\n\n8. Remember What You Actually Control\n\nCompanies restructure, products get killed, teams get reshuffled. But the way you think about problems, the people who trust you, and your ability to figure things out \u2014 that stuff travels with you everywhere.\n\n9. Invest in Yourself First\n\nThe work you do on yourself is the only permanent asset in your career. Every quarter, make some kind of deposit. That's how you go from someone who executes roadmaps to someone who shapes product strategy.\n\n10. Keep Going\n\nThe investment mindset is what separates PMs who survive from PMs who thrive. It's the only thing that never gets disrupted.",
